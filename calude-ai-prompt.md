Looking to run a cypher query, with the following. given that we have the following knowns:

We have 10 refugee camps within 500m from sea or river
HDX already has population data "Internally Displaced" and the long/lat info where camp is located
elevation of camps above sea level

What flood forecasting variables should I plug in to determine which camps are most at risk and how many folks need to evacuate?
